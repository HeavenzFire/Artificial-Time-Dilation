# Artificial Time Dilation for Reinforcement Learning

A research project exploring the application of artificial time dilation concepts to accelerate reinforcement learning training through simulation speed scaling.

## Overview

This project implements and demonstrates how velocity-based time dilation can be applied to AI agents in digital environments to accelerate breakthroughs. By scaling simulation speed (analogous to relativistic velocity), we can compress years of RL training into real-world hours.

## Key Features

- **Time Dilation Simulation**: Core algorithms for scaling simulation time vs real-world time
- **MuJoCo Integration**: RL environment support with configurable physics parameters
- **Interactive Visualizations**: D-scaling charts and reward curve analysis
- **Research Paper**: Complete academic paper with LaTeX formatting
- **Web Demo**: Interactive demonstration of time dilation effects
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all components

## Core Concepts

### Time Dilation Factor (D)
The dilation factor represents the ratio of simulated time steps to real-world time, scaling with computational speed:
- D = 1: Real-time simulation
- D = 100: 100x faster than real-time
- D = 1000: 1000x faster than real-time

### Simulation Speed Scaling
Higher simulation speeds amplify effective training time, enabling RL agents to experience "centuries" of training in days.

## Research Applications

- **Accelerated RL Training**: Compress years of training into hours
- **Breakthrough Discovery**: Enable rapid exploration of RL algorithms
- **Resource Optimization**: Maximize training efficiency
- **Physics Simulation**: Apply relativistic concepts to digital environments
